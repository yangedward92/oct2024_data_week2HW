Data Bootcamp Week 2 HW - VBA

In this homework we will be using VBA scripting to analyze generated stock market data

Trial and error, a lot of it. With the help of the professor and following along during structured offcie hours before class it made more sense on how to think logically and build step by step. Most of the code is definitely done by following along with the professor, I replaced a lot of my attempted code to match so the script could run. It was easier to understand once he broke it down.

Though VBA scripting will not be used much or at all during the rest of this boot camp. I do see some value in it for specific areas for data analyzing. I am definitely still a beginner and I hope this homework kind of shows just how much there is to learn and how just thinking differently will the perspective or approach.
